### Heart Falure:
#### According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 2018 there were 6.2 million adults in the United States living with heart failure. Fatality from this condition in the same year was 13.4 percent. Armed with this information, our mission was to be able to predict fatal heart failure based on 12 unique factors. These factors include age, anemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetic, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium, sex, smoking, and time between follow up appointments. This real-life data was acquired through Kaggle (Link above). In our analysis we utilized seven machine learning models to gain better insight into the best factors of indication and categorical predictions. The machine models utilized were decision tree, random forest, logistical regression, support vector machine, K nearest neighbors, neural networks, and deep learning. The model with the best accuracy rate was Support Vector Machine with an accuracy rate of almost 90 percent. The best indicators of fatal heart failure were the time between follow up appointments (36%), serum creatinine (16%) levels, and ejection fraction (12%). Finally, below you will see the predictive confusion matrices for the normalized and non-normalized outcomes for the decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine models.
